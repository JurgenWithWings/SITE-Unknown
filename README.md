# AREA: Unknown

**Public Development Build (Very early development right now)**

This is the landing place for all the minor development versions of AREA: Unknown.

<br/>

**What is AREA: Unknown?**

This is a management game of sorts. You are the manager of a new SCP reaserch and containment facility for anomolous entities. This will involve having to find and capture anomolous entities and bring them back to the facility you are constructing. You only have a limited amount of funding, increased by taking care of more and more SCPs. Keeping them in good condition will result in bonuses to the funding of the facility & reaserch. 

<br/>

Leaving feedback with your thoughts on the game is greatly appreciated and helps massively in development.
